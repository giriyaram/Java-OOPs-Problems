**J057.** Create a java application where we have a bank it will provide customer details like account number, ifsc code,
atm pin, and available balance to a customer then customer has to display all the values by using a user defined method
and then invoke this method under main method by providing dynamic inputs.

**J058.** Create a java application where we have a mobile manufacturing compony which will manufacture respected branded
mobile phone with specifications like ram, rom, camera, processor, operating system, battery and price and this mobile
is released into wholesale market where the price has to increase by 10% and then from here it is taken to retail market
where the price has to increase by 10% again from here this mobile phone is purchased by a customer and customer has to
display all the specifications of the mobile phone by using a user defined method and this invoke this method under
main method by providing dynamic inputs.

**J059.** Create a java application where we have a software company it will provide details like employee id, employee name,
employee designation, employee salary to five different employees every employe has to display their own details with
respect to one user defined method and invoke all those methods under main.

**J060.** Create a java application where we have to satisfy hybrid inheritance by using above diagramatic representation.

**J061.** Create a java application where we need to satisfy super at variable level.

**J062.** Create a Java application where we have one class it contains one method m1 having parameter String and it is going
to return a boolean value and then inherit this class into another class which also has the same method with same
method name, same parameter, and same return type then inherit this class into one more class there also we have same
method with same name, parameter and return type. then if we invoke the bottommost derived class method under the main method
from there it has to invoke the intermediate base class method and from there it has to invoke top most base class method by
providing Dynamic inputs with respect to the super keyword.

**J063.** Create a Java app where we have one class it contains one DC then inherit this class into the DC of another class then
inherit this class into the PC of another class and then this class into the PC of another class and then inherit this class
into the DC of another class. then if we invoke the bottommost derived class constructor under the main method from there
it has to invoke intermediate base class constructors by using the super keyword and then from there it has to invoke top
most base class constructor by using a super keyword by giving dynamic inputs.

**J064.** Create a java application where we need to satisfy super keyword at all levels by using only two classes.

**J065.** Create a Java Application where we need to satisfy user - A Relationship.

**J066.** Create a Java Application where we need to satisfy Is - A Relationship

**J067.** Create java application where we have one class like A, it contains three methods like m1, m2, and m3 with parameters
and return types, we have another class like B, which contains 3 more methods like m4, m5, m6 with parameters and return
types then we have to invoke m2 method under m5 method and m3 under m6 and then m5 and m6 under main method by providing
dynamic inputs.
